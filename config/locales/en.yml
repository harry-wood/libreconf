      <p>The State of the Map (SotM) conference is the annual conference of OpenStreetMap. Organised by the OpenStreetMap Foundation it has been held each year since 2007. There have also been any other regional and local conferences named <i>State of the Map</i>.</p>
      <p>After being in Europe, North America and Asia, it is time to explore yet another continent. The OpenStreetMap Foundation is happy to announce that the 8th international State of the Map 2014 conference will be held in Buenos Aires, Argentina on November 7th–9th.</p>
      <p>OSM is a truly global project with people all over the globe. Having SotM14 in Argentina is a great way to show the world what’s going on in South America regarding OSM and it can help strengthen the local OSM communities there.</p>

    html: |
      <p>The National Geographic Institue (Instituto Geográfico Nacional - IGN) is a public organism which has as its main mission the representation of the national territory through the official cartography and watching over so that maps of the Argentine Republic which are made, that come in or that circulate inside the country are compliant with that official cartography.</p>
      <p>Being such an important organism inside the geomatic world, it's a pleasure, a pride and an honour to count with their facilities to accomplish this event in search of strenghtening the community sourrounding geographical information systems and geospatial data.</p>
      <p>The IGN counts with an auditorium for approximately 300 people and many smaller rooms for the workshops and expositions.</p>
      <p>It is located on Cabildo street, in Palermo neighbourhood and it's easily reached through public transportation.</p>
