      <p><strong><a href='#' rel='tooltip' title='Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial'>FOSS4G</a></strong> are conferences about <strong>Free Geomatics</strong> that are held every year on differnt parts of the world. A global conference is organized by <strong><a href='http://www.osgeo.org' rel='tooltip' title='Open Source Geospatial Foundation'>OSGeo</a></strong> and in 2013 it will take place in Nottingham, United Kingdom. Besides the global one, there are other local conferences in: North America, Eastern Europe, Spain, Japan, India and others.</p>
      <p>Starting on 2013, FOSS4G Buenos Aires intends to gather the members of the geomatics community from Argentina and the rest of the latin american countries. As well as in the global conference, we expect to have a mix of workshops, projects presentations and expositions about use cases of free tools applied to geomatics. It is also an event promoting the interaction between users of geomatics from different environments and places.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sharing</strong> experiences, projects and ideas around free geomatics</li>

      </ul>
      <p>The conference is aimed at:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Decision makers from different government organisms</li>
        <li>State employees related with GIS</li>
        <li>Members of <a href='http://www.idera.gob.ar' rel='tooltip' title='Infraestructura de Datos Espaciales de la República Argentina'>IDERA</a></li>

  venue_about:
    html: |
      <p>The National Geographic Institue (Instituto Geográfico Nacional - IGN) is a public organism which has as its main mission the representation of the national territory through the official cartography and watching over so that maps of the Argentine Republic which are made, that come in or that circulate inside the country are compliant with that official cartography.</p>
      <p>Being such an important organism inside the geomatic world, it's a pleasure, a pride and an honour to count with their facilities to accomplish this event in search of strenghtening the community sourrounding geographical information systems and geospatial data.</p>
      <p>The IGN counts with an auditorium for approximately 300 people and many smaller rooms for the workshops and expositions.</p>
      <p>It is located on Cabildo street, in Palermo neighbourhood and it's easily reached through public transportation.</p>
